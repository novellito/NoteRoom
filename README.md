# NoteRoom

A collaborative notetaking experience. 

This project was created by:
* Christian Trinidad
* Gabriel Alabastro
* Anando Mahbubah
* Raymond Nazaryan
* Aryan Mokhber

## Technologies Used
* PHP & Laravel Framework
* Node.js -- Socket.io, Quill.js
* MYSQL
* HTML/CSS & Bootstrap

## My Contributions
My contributions to this project include setting up the key functionality of the application, which was setting up Socket.io and Quill.js. Quill.js allows students to type on the text editor, while Socket.io allowed multiple students to take notes and receive updates from the other students typing. I also led the frontend aspect of the project, so setting up views and anything visible to the user was my work.
